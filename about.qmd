I am originally from New Delhi, India, but have grown up moving around the world â€” living in six cities across four countries. 

I studied Mathematics and Economics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. After graduating, I joined the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the International Monetary Fund as Research Assistant, where I worked on projects relating to household inflation expectations and monetary policy transmission. These experiences deepened my interest in how uncertainty, communication, and expectations influence macroeconomic outcomes.

In August 2024, I moved to Providence to pursue my Ph.D. in Economics at Brown University. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis and exploring new cities.
